1. The four criterias for free software are:
	
	1. The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
	2. The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing
	   as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
	3. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).
	4. The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). 
	   By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. 
	   Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

2. Choosing a license is very important because the license for a code determines who can contribute to it or use it
   and ultimately determines how widely it is used or ignored. Using a pre-existing license means that other developers
   are more comfortable using or contributing to your code since they already know about the license. On the otherhand, 
   using a license that is too strict or unknown may scare away many potential coders.

3. Coders should not use a project that doesn't have a explicit license. Without a license, the four criterials for free software 
   are not guaranteed. Without a license, you have no rights to use the code. Therefore, it is important to only use projects
   with explicit licenses or you may have copyright and legal issues.

4. I think that claim is correct. Gopher failed because it did not make it open source. I think that when the majority of 
   the people who use Gopher has the ability to contribute to the code and improve it, then it should have been made 
   open source. Tools such as Microsoft Word should not be open source, since the majority of people who use it do not
   have to ability to contribute to it its code. However, the people who use tools such as Gopher and HTML are mostly
   coders themselves, so making it open source early will allow them to gain a lot of useful contribution.

5. GPL v2 is a good choice for Linux. GPL is the most widely used free software license. Since linux is completely free,
   there is no reason to use other licenses. GPL is the standard license used for free sofware and is the best choice 
   for Linux.

6. GPL, because it is the most widely used and it is copyleft.

7. GPL best for common good. Strong copyleft.
   Apache/BSD best for developers, as it allows the developers to make money while still getting contributions.
   LGPL best for companies, as it allows for inhouse development.
