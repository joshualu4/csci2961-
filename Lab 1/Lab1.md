Have screenshots that show completion of all the lab work. 

1. Linux booted and wifi setup
2. Tree directory installed and working
3. Github repository created and connected locally

Basically, this lab was about setting up the ubuntu/github environment. Fairly easy, since I have been using these in the past. For the project, I think I will search and brainstorm for my own ideas. I'm a CS senior and I am thinking of starting my own company.
